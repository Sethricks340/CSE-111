CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

1. What is the title of your program?
Projectile Motion Calculator

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
This will help solve the real-world scenario of a projectile motion
physics question. It will allow a physicist to input the variables of projectile 
motion into the calculator, and then know the other variables along with 
a visual representation. This will only be in 2D, because I don't know how
to do 3D projectiles with the calculations or the programming.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
I will learn how to use functions to solve for several systems of equations
in a single kinematics problem, and how to display the graph of projectile for the user to see.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
Some modules I will be using are matplotlib, pytest, numpy, and math

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
Yes, I will have several functions that solve for the needed projectile motion variables.
For example, if the user's information renders it possible to create the equation, then the function will tell me so.
I will also have several functions that actually compute the other variables needed for the equation based on the different
possible values that the user could've possibly put in. I will then have functions to put this into information that 
can be displayed on the screen for the user to see an analyze.

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?
Yes, I will write test functions for all the program functions I write in order to 
ensure that they output the correct values for the given amount of variables, and that 
my equations are correctly set up. It will also test that the program is able to sense if 
there is not enough usable information.
